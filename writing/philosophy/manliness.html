    <h1>On Manliness and Masculinity</h1>
    <p class="pullquote">
    "What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets..." &mdash; Dracula
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many questions relating to manhood that one may ask.
      For example, "what is a man?" may be one such question, or "what does it mean to be a man?" may be another.
      These types of questions are easily nitpicked to address the nature of <i>men</i> without addressing the main idea of <i>manhood</i>.
      That is because what it is to be a man and what it is to by manly are two different things.
      A man is a man, regardless of how manly of a man he may be.
      Therefore, his manliness (or lack of) cannot define him as a man.
      Likewise, his being a man does not guarantee that he is manly.
      Manliness is therefore male masculinity.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is easy to define a man scientifically as a person who is born with the chromosomes XY <a href="#f1">[1]</a>.
    However, my aim is not necessarily to delve into the scientific, but rather the philosophical nature of a man.
    So, then, what is a man?
    </p>
    <p class="footnote" id=f1>
      Edge cases like XXY or XYY don't define the 99.9% of cases that are XY.
      These people are, for all intents and purposes, genetic anomalies, and are very rare exceptions to the rule.
      Regardless, even those who are infertile have a reproductive system built for one of two gametes (sperm or ova).
      On that vein, there have been no documented cases of any person having both reproductive systems, even if they posess both genitals (if that were true/possible, there could exist a person who
      can self-conceive, and there is no such person).
      That said, I am open-minded to legitimate research that throws established science into question.
    </p>
    <h2>Manliness as a Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      One may say that being manly is simply a mindset, or identity.
      However, there are scores of men who believe certain things, or behave a certain way, but will fail when tasked with acting out those beliefs.
      Everybody knows at least one man who is "all talk", one who likes to boast and brag, but never actually does anything.
      Now it could be said that such a man does not actually have the mindset of being manly because if he did, then he wouldn't be "all talk";
      that is to say that such a man is a pretender.
