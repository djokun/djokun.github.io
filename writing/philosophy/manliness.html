    <h1>On Manliness and Masculinity</h1>
    <p class="pullquote">
    "What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets..." &mdash; Dracula
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many questions relating to manhood that one may ask.
      For example, "what is a man?" may be one such question, or "what does it mean to be a man?" may be another.
      These types of questions are easily nitpicked to address the nature of <i>men</i> without addressing the main idea of <i>manhood</i>.
      That is because what it is to be a man and what it is to by manly are two different things.
      A man is a man, regardless of how manly of a man he may be.
      Therefore, his manliness (or lack of) cannot define him as a man.
      Likewise, his being a man does not guarantee that he is manly.
      Manliness is therefore male masculinity.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is easy to define a man scientifically as a person who is born with the chromosomes XY <a href="#f1">[1]</a>.
    However, my aim is not necessarily to delve into the scientific, but rather the philosophical nature of a man.
    So, then, what is a man?
    </p>
    <p class="footnote" id=f1>
      [1] Edge cases like XXY or XYY don't define the 99.9% of cases that are XY.
      These people are, for all intents and purposes, genetic anomalies, and are very rare exceptions to the rule.
      Regardless, even those who are infertile have a reproductive system built for one of two gametes (sperm or ova).
      On that vein, there have been no documented cases of any person having both reproductive systems, even if that person posess both genitals (if that were true/possible, there could exist a person who can self-conceive, and there is no such person).
      That said, I am open-minded to legitimate research that throws established science into question.
    </p>
    <h2>Manliness as a Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      One may say that being manly is simply a mindset, or identity.
      However, there are scores of men who believe certain things, or behave a certain way, but will fail when tasked with acting out those beliefs.
      Everybody knows at least one man who is "all talk", one who likes to boast and brag, but never actually does anything.
      Now it could be said that such a man does not actually have the mindset of being manly because if he did, then he wouldn't be "all talk";
      that is to say that such a man is a pretender.
    </p>
    <p>
    Manliness as a mindset also falls apart due to the fact that attitudes towards manliness are highly dependent on culture.
    For example, how men think about manliness is very different in South Africa than in France.
    Manliness cannot be correlated to what sort of <i>mindset</i> a man has, because manliness preceeds mindset.
    No man is manly because of his mindset; he has certain mindset because he is manly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Variability in mindset is the biggest reason why mindset cannot be the precursor to manliness.
    Although being manly paves the way to many positive outcomes, there is no argument that there are not also negative attributes.
    A sense of superiority towards women is a mindset that can be derived from manliness, often as a way to counteract general feelings of inferiority towards other men.
    Such a man can always fall back on being better than the fairer sex, no matter how wretched his own existence.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another negative manly mindset towards women is the total opposite: sheer unbridled reverence.
    Where the former mindset seeks to use and take advantage of women, the latter mindset allows women to use and take advantage of oneself.
    One merely has to look at the scores of military men abused for their benefits and pensions, unfathomably lonely men giving their paychecks to anonymous "models" on the Internet, and "white knights" who viciously defend abhorrent behaviors portrayed by women with sex appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
    Both of the discussed negative mindsets come from the manly desire for control and ownership <a href="#f2">[2]</a>, misdirected towards women.
    Desire for control and ownership is an essential manly quality, and in a healthy man it is directed towards a sense of purpose and betterment of self and society.
    In an unhealthy man, it is vented through aggression.
    If mindset defines manliness, then the most popular male aggression of the culture becomes the defining attributes of men, instead of the defining attributes of men dictating how men should think and behave.
    </p>
    <p class="footnote" id="f2">
    [2] It might seem contradictory that a desire for control and ownership towards a woman can somehow lead to becoming someone who is controlled and owned <i>by</i> a woman.
    A lot of common sensibilities are not applicable when it comes to cases of abuse.
    When a man is lonely and desperate for attention from women he is seeking a woman to call "his".
    Even if she is using and controlling him, even if she is using and controlling other men as well, he can always delude himself that he is the true love, and that she will always come back to him, because she is his.
    That is why even in the face of obvious toxicity, the lonely man's desire to control and own a woman prevents him from seeing it and allows the tables to be turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
    A positive attitude towards women treats them with respect and dignity as equal complements in our species.
    That means neither revering them nor putting them down.
    This is a manly mindset, equally manly to the previous two, but resulting from the positive application of control and ownership of a man's self.
    When a man has true control and ownership of himself, there is no need to direct negative aggression  <a href="#f3">[3]</a>  towards others.
    </p>
    <p class="footnote" id="f3">
    [3] There is such a thing as positive aggression.
    For example, protecting something or someone you care about is positive aggression (however, jealousy is negative aggression).
    Ambition can also positive aggression.
    </p>
    <h2>Manliness as a Quality</h2>
    <p>
    If manliness is not a mindset, then surely it follows that it must be a quality or attribute posessed by men, right?
    Or perhaps it is the combination of certain qualities that makes a man manly.
    Certain qualities immediately come to mind, among them being strength, leadership, comradery, and bravery.
    It is nice to envision the essence of manliness as the most positive qualities attributed to men, but that is naive.
    Most men do not fit the description of a hero, yet they are still men, and they are still manly.
    The idealized man may be what men strive to be, but he is not what men essentially are.
    </p>
    <p>
    To be specific, I do not think of manliness as <i>simply</i> or <i>essentially</i> a quality in the same way that color is a quality.
    The qualities of something cannot be said to have positive or negative aspects;
    for example, the fact that a leaf is green isn't a statement about the good nature of the leaf.
    Manliness is different from the color of a leaf in that it also describes the good and bad natures of a man.
    In other words, it is <i>multi-faceted</i>.
    </p>
    <h2>The Essence of Manliness</h2>
    <p>
    There are three essential questions of manliness.
    <ol>
    <li>Is manliness restricted to men?</li>
    <li>Are some men manlier than others?</li>
    <li>Are there men who are not at all manly?</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    These are yes/no questions that are gradually more difficult to answer.
    Let's start with the first one.
    Is manliness restricted to men?
    Intuition tells us yes it is.
    There are masculine women just as there are feminine men, but because a woman is not a man, she cannot be manly even though she may <i>display</i> behaviors and personality traits associated with
    manliness.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second question.
    Are some men manlier than others?
    Once again intuition tells us yes.
    Some men are clearly more manly than other men, but why?
