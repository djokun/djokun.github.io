		or Why Life Can Be Fulfilling

	<p>
	The Bloomer is the antithesis of the Doomer. Whereas the Doomer is the pinnacle of despair and sorrow, the Bloomer has overcome despair and enlightened himself. In this essay I will lay out how one goes from Doomer to Bloomer as well as the justification for having a Bloomer mindset in a seemingly tragic world.
	</p>
	<h2>Capitulation</h2>
	<p>
	The Doomer mindset ironically stems from being hopeful. How can this be? Doomers <i>want</i> change to occur and they bemoan the lack of progress. Someone with no hope for a better future could not have such an outlook. But Bloomers are also hopeful. So how can it be that one hopeful person is happy and another is not? Bloomers have put their faith in something greater than themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
	When one recognizes that they have little control over their life they have two options. They can either resist and insist that they alone control their destiny, or they can surrender and make the best out of what they have. This might seem similar to Buddhism and that is because Buddhism recognizes this duality. Desire truly is the major source of suffering.
	</p>
	<p>
	Control is multi-layered. On the smallest scales people do have an illusion of control. They decide what to eat and where to travel to for example. People have less and less control once you increase the scale. Most people have very little impact on the goings-on of policy on a national scale, yet those policies have consequences for peoples' daily lives.
	</p>
	<p>
	In a lot of ways it's a good thing that people have such little control. It's also quite natural; no one would expect everyone to control everything because that would just be ridiculous. It's hard to imagine how that would even work! But many people wish that they could have influence over more than just their daily musings. "How much better life would be if only I were in charge!" says they.
	</p>
	<p>
	But no one is <i>really</i> in charge. That is where the Doomers make their first fatal mistake, which is the assertion that there are some elites out there who run the whole show. It's obvious to everyone that such elites do exist. However the notion that they aren't just flailing their bodies through space and time like the rest of us is laughable. No one truly knows what's going on, and the lens of self-interest corrupts even evil. A family or clan of evil elites could not possibly maintain the same strategic objective over dozens of generations. People would rather believe that there is someone, even someone evil, in charge than face the terrifying reality of being on a wandering ship with no captain.
	</p>
	<h2>The Fool and The World</h2>
	<p>
	The symbolism in Tarot is very useful for self-reflection, regardless of whether one believes in divination. In fact, the "magic" of Tarot is usually in its capacity as a tool for introspection. In our current selves we can often make very accurate predictions of our future selves. I find the parallel between The Fool, the first (or I guess zeroth) major arcana in the Tarot, and The World, the last major arcana, to be very meaningful.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Fool is you and the sequence of major arcana is The Fool's journey <a href="#f1">[1]</a>. Obviously, then, the journey ends with The World. That is to say, The Fool becomes The World in the end, i.e., when we complete our life's cycle (although this represents not just the life cycle, but also other cycles within the life cycle), we once again join with The World to start the cycle again. That is a foundation of the principles of reincarnation; but whether you believe in reincarnation or not is besides the point. The point is that The World gives us life, and at the end we return back to it.
	</p>
	<p id="f1" class=footnote>[1] You can read about that and other stuff online, it's readily available, so I won't delve deep into the meaning.</p>
	<p>
	We are The Fool because we are naive and ignorant, yet due to our divine spirit we possess limitless potential. Potential in the spiritual sense, because clearly we are limited in physical respects. The World represents reality, not just Earth. In fact, Aleister Crowley's Tarot, inspired by Egyptian mythology, changed the name of The World to The Universe. I personally like the nuance of The World better; it plays well to the ambiguous English definition of the world and it represents the layered nature of reality. There is your world and my world, the world we live in, and <i>the</i> world.
	</p>
	<p>
	So where is the connection? Once one recognizes that they have no control, and nobody is in charge, then they've taken the first steps to realizing that they are The Fool. The next conclusion could be considered a rejection of Judeo-Christian beliefs, which is that, upon death, we rejoin The World to begin anew another cycle. I assert, however, that this is not a rejection of Judeo-Christianity, it is in fact the foundation; since God is The World and its source, and Heaven is to be close to God, it makes sense even under biblical contexts. In other words, whether one calls it The World or God is splitting hairs.
	</p>
	<p>
	The connection between The Fool and The World is integral to the Bloomer mindset. Accepting that there is no captain of this ship and surrendering to the inevitability of rejoining The World is cathartic. Stopping at this step is incomplete, though, and leads to the corrosive belief of nihilism.
	</p>
	<h2>The Nihilist Demon</h2>
	<p>
	Nihilism is a misunderstood branch of philosophy. The common definition of nihilism is that it is the belief that nothing matters. It is not the belief that nothing matters, but nihilist belief is literally in Nothing, capital N. That is to say, that all of The World, or the universe, amounts to is nothingness, or that nothingness is the foundation of reality. There is also the belief that nothing actually exists, that there is no intrinsic value in anything. Of course one has to be careful in distilling a philosphy with centuries of work into a few sentences; but the main principle is that the foundation of The World is nothing. This is such an obvious cop-out that it almost hurts to imagine being a nihilist. The thing about nihilism is that it's <i>easy</i>. It's really easy to believe in Nothing when you realize that you don't really know anything.
	</p>
	<p>
	No one knows for sure the true nature of reality, but I do know this much: nihilism is a corrosive belief. Even the highest supposed benefits of being a nihilist are brought on by other beliefs, i.e., good nihilists aren't really nihilists. It's trendy to be a nihilist. Supposed nihilists often say that nihilism can be positive, that believing in nothing is liberating and allows one to live a more fulfilling life. However most people are not hedonists. Believing in nothing means that nothing one does is important or has any impact whatsoever. That it makes no difference who and what one loves and treasures, and by reciprocal it makes no difference who and what loves them. I think nihilistic beliefs, true nihilism, cause people to kill themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
	I've seen people who claim to be nihilists argue that their belief in Nothing allows them to live life to its fullest, that because "nothing matters", that also means that there is no reason they should endure the pain and hardship that life inflicts upon people. Then in conclusion, they are free to live their life however they please. Such people are closet hedonists and are not true nihilists. To truly believe in Nothing requires one to also accept that they are insignificant, their wants and dreams are insignificant, and their lives are insignificant. Whether such things are important to them personally is also of no value. However they pretend that it is to make themselves feel better, which makes them different from a nihilist. I don't think anyone who is alive can claim to be a nihilist, i.e., one who believes in and whose core beliefs are nihlism. That is because people intrinsically understand that nihilism is corrosive and act on instinct to avoid corrupting their soul.
	</p>
	<h2>The "Indomitable" Soul</h2>
	<p>
	It's a commonly held belief that the human spirit is unconquerable and immutable. That's simply not true. The soul is a <i>self-sustaining</i> energy (for lack of a better word), but that energy is fueled by will <a href="#f2">[2]</a>. Strength of will alone is responsible for the soul's power. That is how weak people give in to evil and strong people do not: because their soul has already been corrupted. That does not mean that the soul can't be healed&mdash;quite the opposite. Just as one suffering from an illness can get better, someone who has an ailment of the soul, i.e., one who has succumbed to evil, can also be healed.
	</p>
	<p id="f2" class=footnote>[2] Since that will comes from the soul, that is considered self-sustaining.</p>
	<p>
	What makes the soul indomitable is the willpower that fuels it. The soul is divine because it is born from The World, but evil is a sickness which can corrupt it. Likewise, apathy also corrupts the soul. 
	</p>
	<h2>Englightenment</h2>
	<p>
	The Doomer's folly lies in his assumption that Earthly matters are all there is. It's no surprise that most Doomers are atheists. I don't want to be misread here; I am not saying that atheists are unhappy people. I am saying that unhappy people tend to believe in nothing, that is to say, they have nothing to believe in (whether that is God or something larger than themselves).
	</p>
	<p>
	When someone stops caring about things their soul suffers because caring is borne primarily from love. It is erroneous to say simply that love heals; that is not entirely false, but it is incomplete. Loving someone does not heal their soul. Only a person who has regained the ability to love themselves can be healed. However that is also not enough. Only a person who can love themselves, unconditionally, enough to <i>care</i> to do what's best (even if it is inconvenient or hurts) can be healed. Conversely, the absense of that love removes the soul's drive and atrophies it like an unused muscle.
	</p>
	<p>
	It's easy to look at the world, see the evil in it, see that evil doesn't go away, and conlcude that the world is flawed. That the world will never get better. That there is no point in trying to lead a good life.
	</p>
	<p>
	Just because evil exists in the world does not mean that the world is cruel or unjust. The world does not take sides, it just is. We barely even know what justice is to begin with. We are taking guesses at what good and evil are. I think we know enough to get by, but clearly not enough to pass ultimate judgment.
	</p>
	<p>
	We think that because someone does not have the things we take for granted that their life must be awful. They didn't "progress" enough. Conversely, we also think that because someone has better things than we do that their life must be just as great. The reverse of envy is pride and vice versa. Unhappy people compare their lives to those of others.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Doomer believes that people who are happy must be stupid; how could someone who isn't stupid be content in a cruel world? This sentiment harkens to the idiom "ignorance is bliss". So the Doomer sees people who aren't depressed like they are and concludes that those people are either stupid or don't care. However, I assert that ignorance is not bliss. When Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they gained knowledge of Good and Evil. With that, they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and forced to wear clothing. Adam and Eve gained <i>consciousness</i> by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. In other words, only those who have knowledge of Good and Evil can be said to have consciousness.
	</p>
	<p>
	Ignorance is not bliss. People who know things that they wish they didn't say that it is, because they wish to unlearn everything unpleasant about their life. But someone who does not know such unpleasant things cannot be happy that they are ignorant because they don't know that they are ignorant. You can't know what you're missing when you don't have it.
	</p>
	<p>
	The truth is that true bliss, englightenment, only comes from the opposite of ignorance. Just as a light shines in darkness and illuminates, clarity arises from a beam of knowledge shining in ignorance. Just as a beam of light must be focused to reveal more in its path, knowledge must also be focused to clarify more and more. Since we do not know how vast the expanse of ignorance is, we will always feel like we don't know anything.
	</p>
	<p>
	For that reason, enlightenment cannot arise from rational sources. Emotional reasoning is like a cannon; too much powder and the cannon will explode, too little powder and the cannon will miss its target. The rational mind exists to direct the emotional mind towards worthy targets. Neither mind encompasses the soul in its entirety, therefore both are necessary for a healthy spirit.
	</p>
	<h2>The Solipsist Antidote</h2>
	<p>
	Life is inherently unsatisfactory because all human knowledge is based on things which are unproven. We take our knowledge on good faith that it is true, yet anyone who regards the fact that nothing can really be proven is met with a crisis. Should they disown all that they know to be familiar and slip into insanity? Or should they ignore reality and accept the insanity of everyday life?
	</p>
	<p>
	We rely on our senses to inform us about nature. This has all been said before. The unfortunate thing is that this line of thinking slips very quickly into solipsism, i.e., the only thing which can be known to be real is one's own mind. This is but one step in the path to enlightenment, and many people stop here.
	</p>
	<p>
	Those who do not see the path forward from here have a low level of empathy. That is not an insult, just a simple truth <a href="#f3">[3]</a>. That is because one who understands that all which they know is their own mind, and concludes from that fact that they are all who exists, is at best confused and at worst lacking in empathy. Empathy is the faculty which allows conscious beings to connect.
	</p>
	<p id="f3" class=footnote>[3] However empathy, like all emotions, can be trained, for it is one of the soul's faculties.</p>
	<p>
	Solipsism and nihilism go hand-in-hand because the same sorts of people fall into both. Doomers are especially likely to be solipsists. The truth is that solipsism results from an inflated ego. "What I am is all that there is because I am only familiar with myself," is what it amounts to. Such people ignore (or worse, lack) the connections they have with others.
	</p>
	<p>
	Such people counter that emotions and connections are just the results of chemical reactions, and so they are no more real than anything else. That is missing the point. I do not claim to have a solution to the mind-body problem. That is also missing the point. There does not have to be a solution; in fact there never will be. One simply has to know the right questions to ask.
	</p>
	<p>
	Why do we feel existential dread? Why is it that, when confronted with unsolveable problems, we do not immediately go insane? Because the mind (soul) is intrinsically separate from the body, and it has a vested interest in preserving the integrity of its vessel for as long as possible. Due to that interest, the mind/spirit has ways of ensuring that its body does not act against its influence. In that sense the mind can be thought of as a parasite, but that is erroneous because it is the combination of the mind-body which makes us who we are. We cannot exist without both. Therefore the mind-body relationship is best described as symbiotic, not parasitic.
	</p>
	<p>
	Which one is the "real" you, the mind or the body? We have some assumption that the mind/spirit is the "true" self, and the body is merely a carrier of the soul. The mind/spirit is the only part which we know for sure to exist, using only logic. But I posit an extraordinary counteracting idea, which is that logic is the mind/spirit's self-justification for its own existence. The mind/spirit is not self-aware in the sense that the body is self-aware. The body feels itself and has an innate sense of its position, emotional state, and overal physiology. The mind has no such tools. For instance, when the body is sick it responds accordingly to counteract the illness. The mind/spirit has no countermeasures and instead relies solely on willpower <a href="#f4">[4]</a>.
	</p>
	<p id="f4" class=footnote>[4] I want to clarify that I am not talking about mental illnesses, which are actually, for purposes of this essay, illnesses of the body (e.g., chemical imbalances or any other such lack of physical faculties). Instead I am talking about infections to the spirit, hence the mind/spirit.</p>
	<p>
	Logically it makes sense that the mind/spirit is all there is, but followers of solipsism make a fatal error. They trust in the logic and reason which the mind/spirit provides, and conclude from the mind/spirit's own words that it is the be-all-end-all. That is akin to trusting only the words of an island hermit who knows nothing of the world beyond, but has no reason to believe that anything else is there. That does not mean that logic is not a useful tool, but like all tools it has its limitations.
	</p>
	<p>
	The question of which, of the mind/spirit and the body, is the "real" you, remains unanswered, but we have established that we have no reason to trust only in the mind/spirit. To me there are two possibliities, and in either case we must cast off the limitations of duality and embrace an alternative. The first possibility is that there is a third self besides the mind/spirit and the body. The second possibility is that there is considerable overlap between the mind/spirit and the body to the point where the two may be indistinguishible during life. In fact, if the second possibility is to be believed, then it would not matter how many selves there are, for all of them would be unrecognizable. In either case, the result is a rejection of solipsism in favor of empathism.
	</p>
	<h2>Empathy as the True Self</h2>
	<p>
	How can something which is conscious be unsure of its own existence? If, and only if, that entity is restrained by another and subordinate to it, could that be the case. Plato put forth the idea of three selves; the logical mind, the emotional soul, and the insatiable body. Plato, through Socrates, compares the body to a multi-headed hydra, the soul to a lion, and the mind as a little man. Through that allegory, the lion is what fends off the hydra from devouring the little man, preventing insanity. Of course, the little man also represents the "true" self.
	</p>
	<p>
	I don't think that's quite right, in fact, I believe that although the hierarchy is correct, the real balance of power is not. Plato gives the body the most authority, which seems reasonable. After all, most everyone succumbs to the whims of the body eventually. However the importance of the body is misattributed to its supposed authority over the mind/spirit. As a result Plato sees the body as something to be tamed.
	</p>
	<p>
	The truth, I think, is counter to Plato's reasoning. Death occurs when the body's needs are neglected. The fact that, at will, any person could choose to die is enough to dispel Plato's model, for if it were as Plato asserted then the body would prevent the mind/spirit from killing it instead of obeying its master. The body, then, is not an enemy to be tamed, but rather a loyal companion.
	</p>
	<p>
	The mind/spirit actually has ruling authority; when the body shows sufficient signs of distress the mind/spirit will act to defend it because the mind/spirit seeks to protect the body for as long as it possibly can. The body and mind/spirit form a symbiotic relationship driven by willpower. Together, they form, for lack of a better term, a prison which encases the life force: empathy. The third self is this very life force.
	</p>
	<p>
	Logic alone is not enough to generate consciousness. If that were true, then computers would be much more conscious than we are. In fact, we would just be really badly programmed computers. I choose not to believe such insanity. We have no such "proof" of consciousness, because consciousness cannot be proven empirically&mdash;because empiricism relies on logic, which consciousness is not fully borne from and so does not abide by. "Proving" consciousness requires intuition, which is necessarily derived from being conscious.
	</p>
	<p>
	As I said before, logic is the mind/spirit's faculty for self-justification. It allows the mind/spirit to survive in this world of fragile bodies and prevents the body from going insane. I don't want to be construed as to believe that reason is unimportant (although I don't very well know how that could happen because I am obviously making logical deductions and inductions in this essay).
	</p>
	<p>
	Until this point I have referred to the mind as the mind/spirit partly because it is a convenient label. Many have theorized that the mind and spirit are connected or the very same thing. I don't disagree, but my use of spirit should not be conflated with <i>soul</i>. Since those words are normally synonyms, I have carefully chosen to group mind/spirit together and leave soul separate. I know there may be confusion, which is why I would like to explain myself at this moment. When the mind/spirit is joined with the life force (empathy), the soul is the form provided by their union, just as mixing two fluids yields another fluid mixture, which, while different from its constituents, has qualities resulting from both. In that sense the mind/spirit and the soul are similar but different because the soul is the mind/spirit joined with empathy.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Bloomer Revelation, then, is this: empathy is the true self, and at the same time the self is a fragment of The World encased in the mind-body. Put together, those components generate consciousness, deriving self-awareness from the mind/spirit, life force from empathy, and physicality from the body. That is why we may question our own existence even though we are self-aware; it is why we may choose death despite the machinations of the body; it is why we act intuitively and justify it with logic. From The World we are born and upon death we return to it. As above, so below.
	</p>
	<h2>Fulfillment</h2>
	<p>
	Leading a fulfilling life is difficult for someone who embraces their mind-body prison. That is also why it is so easy to be a Doomer. We may see our world around us and conclude that is all there is, or at least that is all which is worth pursuing. People who feel fulfilled are so because they cultivate inner virtue. Those people do have external interests and goals, but they recognize that upon death they will be most glad for the things which strengthened their empathy: forming meaningful relationships with others, improving their habits, being creative and spontaneous, and most importantly seeing love as the basis for all that is good. We have the ability to choose our fate because we can choose the fate of our empathy; the alternative is that we let the mind-body dictate our lives and upon death look back on a life of regrets. It's all up to you.
