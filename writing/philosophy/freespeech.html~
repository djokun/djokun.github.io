		On Free Speech
	</h1>
	<div class=copywriting>
	<p>
		I have frequently seen people make the argument that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.
		Such people are always delighted when someone they disagree with faces repercussions for giving their opinion, usually by way of online angry mob.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Free speech protects you from <i>government</i> censorship", chortles they, "It does not protect your shitty opinions from consequences!"
		The people making this claim happen to be of the leftist flavor, but every group who is the dominant collective in a society will use their cultural power to censor other people.
		Right-wing censorship is just as common.
		Therefore I don't want to be construed as attacking leftists just because they happen to be the ones trying to censor people at the time of this writing.
		Also, I am not a lawyer, and I am not making a legal argument, but a philosophical inquiry on the nature of free speech.
	</p>
	<h2>What is "Free" Speech?</h2>
	<p>
		I must start by saying that free speech <i>does</i> actually mean freedom from consequences.
		However there are different levels of free speech to distinguish, because no society has truly free speech.
		Society exists to place restrictions on individuals for collective benefit&mdash;restrictions that we hope are reasonable but sometimes aren't.
		Therefore, in the pure sense, there is no free speech in America or any other country.
		True free speech, that is unrestricted speech, is something I will refer to as <b>pure speech</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a society with pure speech, nothing anyone says, or expresses, would be considered harmful to society.
		It is easy to imagine how such a society would immediately collapse.
		Without even cultural mores on acceptible expression, disagreements would quickly devolve into inane nonsense, essentially leading to a society of rabid monkeys.
		If any society has tried pure speech in the past, they didn't last long.
		Therefore pure speech obviously must be restricted a little, at the very least through unspoken rules of conduct.
		Pure speech with cultural restrictions should be called <b>social speech</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What does it mean to restrict speech?
		A society with only social speech, close to pure speech but with some cultural restrictions, places guidelines on what types of expression are unacceptable.
		Loudly yelling and screaming one's opinion at all hours would likely be seen as unacceptable.
		A person who does that may even be arrested for disturbing the peace.
		Was that person's free speech protection violated?
		<b>No</b>.
		That person was not arrested for the content of their speech but for how that speech was <i>conducted</i>.
		Therefore, social speech is pure speech with behavioral restrictions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Knowing that, it has been shown that social speech, despite having restrictions, is still free speech because the content of the speech is unrestricted.
		But what about the divulgeance of secrets?
		Is that covered under free speech?
		In order to function, societies often find that they must keep certain things secret for the benefit of the collective.
		Societal secrets are often military in nature.
		Speech which is privileged is therefore referred to as <b>secret speech</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Does restricting who may receive secret speech violate free speech protection?
		<b>No</b>.
		Perhaps unintuitive, free speech does not cover secrets because once a secret is established, those parties who are initiated in that secret are trusted to not reveal it.
		That is because those who establish a secret have their own rights to ensure that secret is protected.
		This is true for individuals as well as whole societies.
		Whether governments have the right to establish secrets is an argument for another day;
		the point is that if you entrust someone with a secret and they break that trust, they were not necessarily in their right to do so just because they have free speech protection.
		One could conceive of many situations where a person may be ethically obligated to divulge a secret, however that is not a <i>free speech</i> dilemma, it is a moral dilemma, and therefore it would be protected under different rules.
	</p>
	<p>
		By establishing what free speech is not, we have come closer to understanding what it is.
		Free speech is not pure speech, or social speech, or secret speech, but rather it is what remains.
		Free speech, therefore, is speech which is restricted only by way of its social execution or level of secrecy.
