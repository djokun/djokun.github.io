		Everyone Should Exercise

	<h2>A New Kind of Body Positivity</h2>
	<div class=copywriting>
	<p>
		I never used to exercise.
		I was always one of those kids who no matter what unhealthy habits I had, from lack of exercise to eating tons of junk all the time, it never mattered.
		I was always scrawny.
		Therefore I didn't think too much about exercise&mdash;unless my dad was forcing me to.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be honest, I was quite athletic&mdash;for one who hardly ever exercised (and certainly didn't enjoy doing it).
		I only ever did because I wanted to make my dad happy.
		Perhaps the most important thing I obtained from that, though, was even though I was a pasty, scrawny nerd in middle and high school, I always tried my absolute best in gym classes<a href="#f1">[1]</a>.
		"Losers never win, and winners never give up!" my dad would say.
		Despite having no motivation to exercise, those words stayed with me.

	<p>
		I continued eating junk and not exercising in my early 20s.
		I didn't drink much water.
		I was actually one of those people who thought one should only drink water when they're thirsty <a href=#f2>[2]</a>.
