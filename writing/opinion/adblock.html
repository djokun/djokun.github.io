		Every Browser Should Come With An Adblocker

		Have you ever gone to a cooking blog to find some recipes and thought to yourself, "I wish there were more ads here"?
		Of course not, in fact you probably thought "where is the damn recipe?!".
		Recipe sites are notorious for being a ad-riddled, spaghetti code Javascript messes where you have to scroll endlessly and wade through a swamp of pop-up ads just to find a four-line recipe.
		They aren't alone, either.
		News sites are just as guilty, and it's like "yeah they gotta make money", but why can't they use static ads like they do with newspapers?
		Too much effort?
		I suppose that would interfere with their 24/7 Clickbait&trade; "journalism".

		Ads are a plague to the World Wide Web.
		<i>Every</i> problem with the Internet is because of ads.
		Don't believe me?
		Imagine an Internet without Google adsense and co<a href="#f1">[1]</a>.
		Clickbait would be down 99% because most of it survives parasitically off of advertiser tracking.
		Social Networking Services as we know them would not exist.
		The web would be a smaller, more accessible place.

		[1] You really don't have to imagine it if you are older than 25 years old, because you lived it already.

		With few exceptions, there is no such thing as advertising on the Internet.
		Online "advertising" is not advertising, it is manipulation, because the Internet is the only medium in which advertisers can stalk viewers through tracking cookies<a href="#f2">[2]</a> and Javascript.
		That is why every web browser worth its salt should have an adblocker built into it.
		If a browser values your privacy then it will block tracking and ads without you having to configure it.
