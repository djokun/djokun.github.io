			<br><br>
			<p>
			"Deepfakes" are pornographic videos with the faces of celebrities and other famous figures superimposed with the help of neural networks. At the surface these doctored videos are simply fuel for deranged and horny men on the Internet, but I believe there is an even darker side to these deepfakes. It takes only some critical thought to realize that the problem that face swapping technology imposes is far greater than just the violation of a person's image. What this entails is a threat to society as we know it.
			<br><br>
			Let's begin with something everyone is familiar with: computer generated images, or CGI. Movies nowadays are full of CGI and the technology has gotten so good that, without being told so, it can be difficult to distinguish what has actually been filmed and what was put there in post-production. On the flip side, when the CGI is bad it is painfully obvious. So the trade-off here is that good CGI requires skilled professionals in order to make something convincing. It is for that reason that we are still able to trust video evidence; it is usually not cost-effective to fabricate video, and when it is done there are experts who can still tell the difference.
			<br><br>
			Now let's add "AI" into the mix. Neural networks are capable of learning centuries of knowledge in a short period of time, and the result is that, in applications where huge amounts of data are involved, they are in most cases able to outperform humans (for example, Google's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo" target="_blank" color="yellow";>AlphaGo</a> was able to soundly defeat the world Go champion and the number one Go player). Deepfakes are paving the way for a future in which any person can be made to say or do anything to which they have no knowledge, no intention, no recollection, and no means to actually have done. As the technology advances, Deepfakes will become the ultimate gaslighting tool. We will be unable to trust anything.
			<br><br>
			The good news is that for the time being most Deepfakes are obviously fake, and there are still ways to distinguish the really good ones. My fear, however, is the day when such things are not possible without "AI". Perhaps this is a case of old man syndrome on my part, but I believe that we should not come to rely on artificial intelligence technology to tell us what is real and what is not. If that day ever comes it will destroy the lens through which we look at the world humanely, it will destroy our humanity, and it will cripple us and render us into nothing more than slaves to technology. It should rather be the opposite: technology as a tool for us to make sense of the world, not a master that tells us what sense is.
