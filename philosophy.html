<div><br><u><b>My General Philosophy</b></u></div>
<p>
<br><br>
Someone who has read my website, or who knows me in person will find that my manner of thinking can seem contradictory. So far most of my writing may be taken as nihilistic or pessimistic. I want to write this article to more fully express my general philosophy if only to show that I am not at all nihilistic or pessimistic, in fact I am quite an optimist. I believe there is always hope for the future, but I also believe that hope alone isn't enough to be optimistic. Optimism is useless without consciousness of the potential for tragedy.

	<b><i>There is no one philosophy or set of rules that can govern reality or how we should live.</i></b>
</div>
I can pretty much sum up the entire thing in a few sentences, but I also feel the need to go into detail about exactly <i>why</i> that is. The general rule is thus: there is no one philosophy or set of rules that can govern reality or how we should live. No philosophy is appropriate for every situation. Some of them even go against human nature. For example, Kant's categorical imperative can be very useful, but it is too rigid. Under the categorical imperative something like lying could be considered morally unjust, but there can be a situation where lying is the right thing to do! From a utilitarian perspective, if lying would result in more good than telling the truth, then it may be morally justifiable. But once again there is a problem with that point of view. We can only make guesses about the future, and the further we look the more events become probable in an endless tree of possibilities. So it is really impossible to be absolutely certain that the actions we take will truly lead to the best outcome. There lies the problem with utilitarianism.
<br><br>
The bane of every ethical philosophy is abstraction, which is why nihilism is very attractive. Nihilism doesn't have the weakness of abstraction because the very core of nihilism is the ultimate abstraction: nothingness. Since every other philosophy eventually crumbles, the conclusion must be that there is no meaning! But although that is a logical conclusion, reality is not a very logical or rational place. It is ironically an error in logic that reality is logical. In an effort to make sense of the world we forget that the world doesn't necessarily make any sense! As Plato said, we are trapped in a dark cave looking at shadow puppets, unaware of the true nature of reality outside of our extremely narrow perspective. Everything we believe we know is a <i>guess</i> based on evidence based on an environment filtered through our senses. And so the nihilists conclude that there is nothing, no meaning, but don't realize that it is just as presumptuous as believing we have the answer.
<br><br>
I believe that there is meaning. I cannot prove that there is, only show my thought processes, feelings, and experiences that lead me to believe in meaning. There are three levels to consider in philosophy: the abstract, the practical, and the metaphysical. Each level requires a different approach to finding meaning. Practical philosophy falls apart in the abstract and has no bearing on the metaphysical. Abstract philosophy attempts to supersede the practical, but fails in the face of real situations. Metaphysical philosophy transcends the physical universe and attempts to establish the basis for abstract and practical philosophy, but it is esoteric and apparently detached from reality. The three levels exist on a spectrum from practical to abstract to metaphysical.
