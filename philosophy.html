<div><br><u><b>My General Philosophy</b></u></div>
<p>
<br><br>
Someone who has read my website, or who knows me in person will find that my manner of thinking can seem contradictory. So far most of my writing may be taken as nihilistic or pessimistic. I want to write this article to more fully express my general philosophy if only to show that I am not at all nihilistic or pessimistic, in fact I am quite an optimist. I believe there is always hope for the future, but I also believe that hope alone isn't enough to be optimistic. Optimism is useless without consciousness of the potential for tragedy.

One of my great influences was Aristotle, particularly in his mean virtue ethics. For anyone unfamiliar, Aristotle posited that virtuous qualities come about as a result of a 'golden mean' between two vices. For example, the virtue of courage is just the right amount of cowardice and recklessness. The reason why it is so difficult to be virtuous is because of the spectrum that forms between the two vices. To a coward, courage <i>is</i> recklessness. To one who acts before thinking, it is cowardly not to rush in.
