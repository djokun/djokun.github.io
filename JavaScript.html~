			<br>
			<p style="text-align: justify; ">
			<br>
			JavaScript is a very useful programming language often used for web design. However my issue with JavaScript is threefold:
			<br><br>
			<b>1. Nontrivial JavaScript forces your computer to install software without your knowledge</b>
			<br><br>
			When you visit a webpage that heavily employs JavaScript your web browser downloads software to your computer and executes it without your knowledge. Most, if not all, web browsers are silent when it comes to JavaScript, although most also have a way to disable it completely.
			<br><br>
			<b>2. JavaScript can be a threat to a site visitor's security</b>
			<br><br>
			 Because it is downloaded and executed automatically--and without the visitor's knowledge--if someone injects malicious code into the site's JavaScript then that is also downloaded and executed automatically. Thus JavaScript can pose a security threat to visitors of a webpage. The most common way I have heard of this happening is through advertisements (which is another reason why having an adblocker is also paramount).
			 <br><br>
			 <b>3. Websites that rely on JavaScript cannot function without it</b>
			 <br><br>
			 Since JavaScript can be a security flaw, many people would seek to disable it. However by disabling JavaScript they become unable to use many popular websites.
			 <br>
			 <div style="text-align: center"><a href="../images/2017-09-15-174125_1406x633_scrot.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/2017-09-15-174125_1406x633_scrot_thumbnail.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; height=auto;" align="middle"></a>
			<br>Above: Youtube with JavaScript disabled.			 
			 </div>
			 <br><br>
			 In the end it comes down to a philosophical difference, which is the belief that webpages should be able to load software onto a person's computer without their knowledge or agreeance (it could be argued that <i>visiting</i> a webpage counts as consent, but I think that's like saying that visiting someone's house is consenting to being force-fed) versus the opposite. I believe that people should be able to choose what software to use on their own computer and when.
			 <br><br>
			 Yeah sure, you could just not use the website. But because JavaScript is so widespread now that's basically telling someone not to use the Internet, which in this day and age is absurd. So a better solution would be to either eliminate JavaScript (unlikely because it has actual practical purpose) or to create a better alternative.
			 <br><br><br>
			 For those interested in selectively disabling JavaScript (recommended) look into installing <a href="https://noscript.net/" target="_blank"; style="color: yellow;">NoScript</a>.
