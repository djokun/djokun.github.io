My name is Daniel Okuniewicz Jr. and this is my personal web page. I usually post my writings on here, but I may also post video and audio files in the future. It is basically a creative outlet for me to share whatever I want.

In the future I may make more use of this page for other reasons, personal or professional. I've thought about uploading my CV here but at this point in my life I don't think that'll do anything.

I encourage everyone to read my writing and contact me to talk about just about anything.
