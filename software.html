      <h2>Operating System</h2>
    <p>
      I use GNU/Linux for my personal computing.
      Right now I am using Ubuntu Unity.
      In the past I have used:
      <ul>
        <li>Ubuntu</li>
        <li>Debian</li>
        <li>Arch</li>
        <li>Manjaro</li>
        <li>Void</li>
        <li>Solus</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ubuntu is a solid distro that a lot of people use (therefore a lot of software is available for it) and snapd is really easy to remove if you care about that.
      I used to care, now I honestly don't really mind, as I don't have a lot of packages installed as snaps (just my web browser).
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to be very much into Arch and other rolling release style distros.
      These days I don't really care what distro I use.
      More importantly, I don't care what distro you use.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still recommend Ubuntu for newbies to GNU/Linux simply because it is still the most ubiquitous GNU/Linux distribution out there (not most popular, most ubiquitous).
      A lot of software will work on Ubuntu and is easily available, whereas smaller projects like Solus do not have as many packages.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want something that Just Werks&trade;, any of the following will do:
      <ul>
        <li>Ubuntu</li>
        <li>Manjaro</li>
        <li>Mint</li>
        <li>Solus</li>
        <li>PopOS</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
    <p>
      My personal computer is a Dell Latitude e6440 that I rescued from my university (read: I asked if I could have it because the power port was banjaxed).
      I've never purchased a personal computer in my entire life&mdash;an accomplishment I'm quite proud of.
      Nevertheless people often find themselves in need of a personal computer, whether because their current one broke or they feel they need to upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      I highly recommend, if you must purchase a personal computer, to buy one used or refurbished.
      Not only is it better for the environment, it is just plain savvy.
      Why waste a ton of money on a brand new computer when computers up to 10 years old work just fine?<a href=#f1>[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p id=f1 class=footnote>[1] Computers "slow down" as they age because Windows is awful software. If we're talking about online use it's because most websites are also bad software (Javascript-ridden messes of spaghetti code to load hundreds of megabytes of ads). Install an ad blocker and use something that isn't Windows.</p>
    <p>
      Thinkpads used to be the pinnacle of laptops, but Lenovo is turning them into trash Mac clones like everyone else tries (and fails) to do.
      Not only that, but thinkpads have turned into hipster accessories.
      People want thinkpads because it makes them look cool, rather than for the functionality and dependability.
      Therefore, I recommend getting a Dell or HP equivalent (Dell Latitude series or HP Pavilion series).
      Apple computers are good but they're definitely overpriced.
      Not a problem if you buy used or refurbished, most of the time.
      If you're not into fixing your own computer an Apple will work really well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recently there have been a lot of <a href="https://frame.work">startups</a> focusing on making personal computers that are more customizeable and user-serviceable.
      I haven't had the good fortune to try any of them out!
    </p>
    <h2>Daily Programs</h2>
    <h3>Text Editing</h3>
    <p>
      I use vim for general text editing on my personal computer.
      At work I use VSCode like everyone else.
      I've heard that notepad++ is very good, too.
      I tried to get into (the cult of) emacs but I found myself just using Evil mode, which made me realize that it was kind of pointless for me to switch.
      Vim runs, does what I need it to do, and most importantly, is always on remote systems.
    </p>
    <h3>Documents</h3>
    <p>
      I used to use R markdown compiled to LaTeX, then I changed to using groff.
      Groff is a much simpler typesetting system than LaTeX but it is very powerful.
      Now I use <a href=https://github.com/typst/>typst</a>, which is also free software.
      It is not yet as powerful as LaTeX (yet), but it is incredibly easy to use and there are many cool features that made me love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The benefits of using a typesetting system instead of word processors is that they allow you to focus on the <i>content</i> and worry about the formatting at a different time.
      They are also deterministic, i.e., you will always get the same results when you compile, whereas word processors like Microsoft Word will randomly break your configuration (if, for example, you insert an image in a spot the word processor doesn't like).
      Typesetters like groff and LaTeX work with <i>plaintext</i> and compile them into pretty documents.
      That means you can get all your formatting done separately from your actual work.
      Track changes can even be done using version control software like git!
    </p>
    <h3>Web Browser</h3>
    <p>
      I have mainly used Firefox for most of my life.
      I have used all of the major browsers: Safari, Chrome (and Chromium), Firefox, AOL (yes I mean their web browser), Internet Explorer, Edge, and Brave (technically this is another Chromium flavor).
      In the end I come back to Firefox because it generally lets me do whatever I want, which is to <a href=posts/adblock.html>block every single ad</a>.
