<p>Perhaps the most persistent philosphical quagmire is the question of free will. There are those, particularly scientifically-minded, rational-thinking, individuals who insist that free will is an illusion. The sentiment is that there are but two possiblities of existence: that the universe is probabilistic, i.e., based on random chance, or that future events are already predetermined. In both cases, it seems that free will cannot possibly exist, for if the universe is probabilistic then our choices are also the product of probability‚Äìrandomness. However if future events are already predetermined, then our choices are also already determined by Fate.</p>
<p>The problem with such thinking is that it is built upon false premises.</p>
