Computers are the most prolific tools in modern society. Indeed it seems that nearly everything is powered by computers, from cars to refrigerators, and the myriad of applications for computers is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. So it seems counter-intuitive that despite the growing number and scope of computers in every-day life, it also seems that general computer knowledge is <i>decreasing</i>. But while counter-intuitive at first, at a second glance it's quite obvious that this phenomenon would occur, as it does with everything else.
		<br><br>
Taking cars as an example, it used to be that the people who owned a car would do their own tune-ups. But as car technology grew beyond its original purpose, from a simple mode of transportation to a full-fledged luxury carriage (and it's worth an aside mention that, strangely enough, the status of a car is inversely related to its proliferation, i.e., although it has all the traits of a luxury it is also necessary for survival), the car became too abstract for the everyman.
		<br><br>
I suppose that explanation doesn't really do it justice, though. Although they are more abstract than they were forty years ago, cars are still machines that we can understand with a little effort. The other half of the issue is a culture shift in opposition to self-service. There has been a dramatic shift away from "do it yourself" towards "ask a professional", at least when it comes to commercial products. People who do exhibit a DIY attitude tend to be written off as Hipsters or wannabes for daring to emulate the work of a professional. And in cases where they are not, such as in cars, mentioning that one does their own work is met with "learned ignorance", where people assume that they cannot possibly understand the subject matter, and so the conversation ends prematurely.
