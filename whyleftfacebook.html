		<div><br><b><u>Why I Left Facebook</u></b></div>
		<br><br>
			<p>
			Although a lot of the things I do are on impulse, they are always paradoxically based in careful consideration. There are multiple reasons why I decided to leave Facebook, among which are the following:
			<br><br><br>
			<b>1. Facebook is not really a social network</b>
			<br><br><br>
			Though Facebook claims to be a "social network", I find that the term is very misleading. Indeed, Facebook does connect people together, but it is hardly a network of people so much as it is a network of personalities. Nobody is really who they are on Facebook. Rather the users of Facebook fabricate their identity in a way that suits the culture of the website. This happens in all online communities, but the difference is that Facebook requires (read: pressures) people to tie their real identity to that of their online persona, when in fact they are not the same. People do not act as they do offline on Facebook, and they do not act as they do on Facebook offline (however that line is becoming more blurry due to meme culture).
			<br><br>
			On Facebook people present only what they want people to see. For example, I've seen many couples break up on Facebook that I thought were doing fine. But why? Why would such an apparently good couple break up? Because the relationship wasn't actually good, it was just presented that way on social media. You rarely see the ugly side of people. It's a bubble. A fantasy world for people to escape from their horrible reality. It's no wonder so many people are depressed nowadays; they run away from their life on the Internet. The Internet should be a place that <i>augments</i> your life and it should never become your life. Facebook is taking over our lives and it needs to stop.
			<br><br>
			There is not much actual socialization that happens on Facebook and sites like it. It is better to call it interaction. Although people certainly interact with each other on Facebook, they aren't really socializing, and the reason for that is because Facebook encourages formulaic behavior. People are encouraged to express their emotions with templates which stifles creativity. To anyone reading this I ask: how often do you find yourself browsing Facebook, doing absolutely nothing? How often do you find yourself browsing Facebook on your computer only to check your phone and browse the "other Facebook"? It is a tool for an instant hit of dopamine. There is a rush whenever someone likes your status. Every time someone tags you in a post. Every time someone mentions you in a comment. There's that dopamine.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>2. Facebook is a surveillance tool</b>
			<br><br><br>
			Facebook was one of the first companies to employ facial recognition software. I'll soon write a page on why I think facial recognition is a bad thing, but the short of it is this: Facebook tracks all of your photos and videos, your location, etc. It is a method of surveillance disguised as social media. It doesn't matter if you have nothing to hide, using Facebook is akin to living in a glass house.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>3. I don't like Mark Zuckerberg</b>
			<br><br><br>
			I don't like Mark Zuckerberg.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>4. Little things that bother me</b>
			<br><br><br>
			Facebook is bright blue and white, it's like staring at a light bulb. It's the year two thousand seventeen and there are still websites that think bright fucking white is okay.
			<br><br>
			The website uses JavaScript up the ass and I really don't like JavaScript (might write about that some time, in the meantime if you hate JavaScript as much as I do you can install the <a href="https://noscript.net/" target="_blank";>NoScript</a> browser extension)
			<br><br>
			I don't like Facebook's business model. The site is "free"--that is, you, the supposed customer, is actually the product.
			<br><br><br>
			<b><u>UPDATE: I went back to facebook because I needed it to use tinder lma0, go figure. I still hate it though. I also use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/" target="_blank">umatrix</a> instead of noscript now.</u></b>
			<br><br>
			Most of the things I wrote in this article don't really bother me anymore. I've come to accept them as things which need to be adapted to.
