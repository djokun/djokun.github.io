      My exercise routine is straight-forward, simple, and follows somewhat of a push-pull-legs setup (PPL).
      It is purely calisthenics, so even though I do some of them at a rock gym, they can be done pretty much anywhere.
      I don't follow this routine to the letter, that is to say, although I do run once a week I don't always do it the same day.
      Likewise, I don't always do each exercise twice a week nor on the same day each time.
      A person <a href="#f1">[1]</a> can make serious progress only exercising each muscle group once per week.

      <p class="footnote" id=f1>
      [1] So-called "noob gains" or "newbie gains" occur because fitness gain has diminishing returns on amount of effort put in.
      A total beginner will see more progress in a week than an intermediate or expert.
      Not only is this true for fitness, but it is true for everything, which is why only those who are truly dedicated can become experts and most people taper off at intermediate skill.

      Honestly, not exercizing because you don't like gyms, or you don't have the money to get equipment is a massive excuse.
      You can make a lot of headway using just your body and a floor.
      Find something you like to do and incrementally increase the difficulty.
      If it starts to get easy, you aren't going to keep improving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing is to find something you'll actually keep doing.
      You could be doing the most science-backed&trade;, most effective exercise routine but if you stop doing it then it's just wasted effort.
      If you like and prefer lifting heavy stuff but can't afford weights (thanks inflation), there are ways to <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Weight-Set target=blank_>make your own</a>.
      If you like doing pushups, etc., then you're in luck because that's free.
    </p>

    If you're new to calisthenics or are interested in calisthenics I highly recommend following <a href="http://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/routine" target=blank_>Hampton Liu's program</a>.
