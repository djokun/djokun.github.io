      My routine has gone through many changes over time, starting out very simple and adding more fine-tuning according to my needs.
      For instance, I didn't used to do accessory exercises like chest flies and Y-pulls, but I found that adding them in has vastly improved my gains, both in climbing and in terms of my overall fitness.
      Every exercise that makes sense is done with rings.
      Best $50 I ever spent, to be honest.
      If you don't like the gym and want a simple way to get fit, buy a pair of rings, find a tree and get to it.

      Honestly, not exercizing because you don't like gyms, or you don't have the money to get equipment is a massive excuse.
      You can also make a lot of headway using just your body and a floor.
      Find something you like to do and incrementally increase the difficulty.
      If it starts to get easy, you aren't going to keep improving.

      The most important thing is to find something you'll actually keep doing.
      You could be doing the most science-backed&trade;, most effective exercise routine but if you stop doing it then it's just wasted effort.
      If you like and prefer lifting heavy stuff but can't afford weights (thanks inflation), there are ways to <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Weight-Set target=blank_>make your own</a>.
      If you like doing pushups, etc., then you're in luck because that's free.
