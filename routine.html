      My exercise routine is straight-forward, simple, and follows somewhat of a push-pull-legs setup (PPL).
      It is purely calisthenics, so even though I do some of them at a rock gym, they can be done pretty much anywhere.
      Honestly, not exercizing because you don't like gyms, or you don't have the money to get equipment is a massive excuse.
      You can make serious headway using just your body and a floor.
      Find something you like to do and incrementally increase the difficulty.
      If it starts to get easy, you aren't going to keep improving.

      The most important thing is to find something you'll actually keep doing.
      You could be doing the most science-backed&trade;, most effective exercise routine but if you stop doing it then it's just wasted effort.
      If you like and prefer lifting heavy stuff but can't afford weights (thanks inflation), there are ways to <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Weight-Set target=blank_>make your own</a>.
      If you like doing pushups, etc., then you're in luck because that's free.
