<p>
I like smoking. I take BIG puffs from my cigarette. Except I don't really take puffs. Because I can't breathe. Because I'm a skeleton. I should probably introduce myself, I'm Guy Ogley, I'm a skeleton, and you've probably never talked to a skeleton before so I'm just going to get some things out of the way. Yes, I can talk, and no, I don't pose for photos. Aw who am I kidding, no one wants a photo with a skeleton.
<br><br>
I don't know if you know this or not but skeletons are sensitive creatures. We may just look like a pile of bones to you humans but we have feelings, too. And let me tell you I'm super bojangled right now because I haven't had a day off work in ten years and if you've ever worked food service then you know what kind of hell that is. At least I get smoke breaks.
<br><br>
I work at the Cup of Joe's, where the coffee's hot and the girls are hotter. All the employees are skeletons like myself, but the owner is a human. I like most of my coworkers, but they can be a real pain in the pelvis. Fucking Chris is such a piece of shit.
<br><br> 
I'm ribbing you, though, it's just me here. Me and the owner, Joe. Joe can be a pain in the pelvis himself but he's a good guy all around, for a human. Don't be offended, you have to understand that we skeletons are looked down upon by most humans. I'm not being prejudiced, it's just how it is.
<br><br>
Now before I continue I'm going to have to lay down some ground rules here, since this is my story and I'm showing you the world from my perspective. Hang on I gotta light up a smoke. Okay so eventually there's going to be someone talking and unless you're me you're going to have no idea who it is. So-
<br><br>
"Hey uh, can I get a venti latte?"
<br><br>
"Hold on a second I'm thinking about something important!" Okay so whenever someone who isn't me is talking it'll look like this:
<br>
<div id="char">CUSTOMER:</div>
<div class="cj" id="dialog">Hey what's your problem, guy?</div>
<br>
And whenever it's me it'll look like this:
<br>
<div id="char">ME:</div>
<div class="cj" id="dialog">How do you know my name who the fuck are you? And we don't serve venti here this isn't Starfucks.</div>
<br>
<div id="char">CUSTOMER:</div>
<div class="cj" id="dialog">Look just give me a medium latte, alright?</div>
<br><br>
<div id="char">ME:</div>
<div class="cj" id="dialog">That'll be thirty-five seconds</div>
<br>
Why are customers so rude? And yeah I know thirty-five seconds is kind of a lot for a latte but I hear they're pretty good. Anyways the point is that I don't want to have to explain who's talking all the time because that'll get tiring.
