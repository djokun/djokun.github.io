<div><br><u><b>Petty Environmental Won't Save The World</b></u></div>
<p>
<br><br>
In the past months I've seen a lot of calls to ban plastic straws in order to help the environment. While I believe environmental activism is a good cause, I have disdain for things which I've taken to calling 'petty environmentalism'. Petty environmentalism is a fixation on reducing mundane things in a misguided effort to save the world. Petty environmentalists are obsessed with reducing their own already small carbon footprint ever more. It gets to the point where they would go out of their way if only to reduce that all-important footprint by the next fraction of a percent. Petty environmentalists do it for the ego boost, for the virtue points they get from broadcasting to the world how environmentally savvy they are. In reality they are doing effectively nothing to help the planet.
<br><br>
While the 97-3 ratio of industrial waste to municiple waste may be <a href="https://discardstudies.com/2016/03/02/municipal-versus-industrial-waste-a-3-97-ratio-or-something-else-entirely" target="_blank">erroneous</a>, it is clear that industrial waste is a much bigger factor than all the personal waste we excrete each year. Even if we got every person to become a petty environmentalist and reduce their total waste output to zero, that would still not account for the enormous amount of waste produced by corporations and commercial businesses. Airlines, automobiles, trains, power plants--all of these aspects and more must also be figured in.
<br><br>
Consider the amount of political effort it took for California to ban plastic straws. Imagine if that effort was exerted on something less trivial like Nestlé's evil (and illegal) water bottling practices that they somehow get away with. Perhaps meaningful change could have been produced. Instead people can <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/plastic-straw-ban-you-can-be-sent-jail-breaking-new-law-california-city-1043944" target="_blank">be jailed</a> for serving people unsolicited plastic straws. For giving someone a piece of plastic.
<br><br>
There are much bigger fish to fry when it comes to saving the planet, and those fish are not individual people or restaurants serving plastic eating utensils. They are the corporate giants that treat the planet like a poor village for them to plunder for all its resources and leave the remaining people (future generations) to fend for scraps or succumb to disease. Who cares about plastic when Africa and South America are still being molested by foreign corporations--backed by governments. Plastic won't even <a href="https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-enzyme-plastic-waste#page-2" target="_blank">be a problem</a> for long anyway.
<br><br>
It's very easy to focus just on yourself. It's really comforting to know that even when the world is on fire, at least you weren't the problem. No, the problem was everyone else; everyone else's carbon footprint was higher than yours! Everyone else was throwing away rotten food instead of composting it like a good Global Citizen™. Everyone else was busy using ziplock bags instead of mason jars, what a waste!
