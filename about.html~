		About Me	
	</h1>
	<div class=copyinfo>
	<p>
		My name is Dan Okuniewicz Jr.
		I dropped out of college in 2016.
		In 2019 I went back and got a degree in environmental science with a concentration in hydrology.
		Always remember it's never too late to pursue something!
	</p>
	<p>
		Likes: Water (need it to live), bees, chess, video games, beer, libre software, seafood.
		<br>
		Dislikes: Wasps (the insect), most cheeses (unfortunately), javascript.
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm generally an easy person to get along with once you get past my capybara exterior.
		I'm very tolerant towards other people's points of view (whether you agree with them or not).
		One of my core beliefs is in uncensored speech, both IRL and Online.
		Evil only survives when it is unexposed; by censoring we allow evil groups to fester and grow.
		The only chance that good ideas have against bad ones is through direct competition.
		Therefore, aside from a few reasonable guidelines (for example, not allowing people to instruct others to commit acts of violence), I believe that a healthy society relies on free exchange of ideas, even the bad ones.
	</p>
	<p>
		On that vein, I believe that social networking services (SNS) have had a net negative impact on our society and that we should all do our best to limit their use.
		I do understand that SNS provide vital functionality in our current society, and as such it is very difficult to completely cut ties with them.
		For such cases (as in my case) I recommend only using them when necessary.
