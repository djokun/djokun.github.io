		<div style="text-align: center;"><br><b>Memes: The Bad and the Good</b></div>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
		<br><br>
		The proliferation of memes on the Internet has affected culture to the point where most Internet activity is just users clicking buttons on infographics and video and sharing them with friends. They do this without any regard to the source, the validity, or the quality of the content because proliferating it is as easy as pressing a button. "Meme" has come to refer to anything that gets passed along to thousands of people (or three people) even if it isn't humorous. We used to have places where you could find all kinds of "memes", they're called libraries.
		<br><br>
		This isn't a case of Old Man Syndrome, either. I'm not saying that we should go back to painstakingly combing through stacks of books whenever we need to research something, but it has to be said that as ease of use increases the quality of work actually begins to drop.
		<br><br>
		<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="images/easevsquality.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height=auto;"></div>
		<br><br>
		The quality drops because when something gets really easy it becomes more convenient to forego other essential things like accuracy. If all you have to do to proliferate a meme is press a button then that's all most people are going to do. Even though fact checking is as easy as firing up a search engine and typing some words in, who's going to go through that trouble over a shitty infographic with doctored images and poorly aligned text?
		<br><br>
		<div><img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; max-width: 50%;" src="http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/graphics/hillarybinladen3.jpg">
		<br>Wow did you know that Hillary Clinton shook hands with Osama Bin Laden? Anybody with functioning eyes and basic pattern recognition can tell this image is doctored because the <a href="http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/21/67bc416a8b3f0716770f6a706700f359.jpg" target="_blank">source image</a> of Bin Laden (read: the most iconic and famous picture of Osama Bin Laden) has a facial expression that is identical to the one used in this photo. But let's assume someone has never seen that photo of Bin Laden. Aside from the fact that if you look carefully at the picture you can easily tell that Bin Laden's head is superimposed, let's talk about the availability of image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. Any second-rate journalist can download GIMP or buy Photoshop and screw around with a picture of a famous person and pass it off as the real thing. The thing that prevents credible journalists from doing that is that they have credibility. And that isn't to say that their credibility makes them trustworthy. Their reputation for being credible is more powerful in keeping them honest than their trustworthiness itself, because if anyone ever found out that they lied about something they lose that trust, whereas a second-rate journalist who lies from the get go has nothing to lose.
		<br><br>
		So they find a picture of Hillary Clinton at a party, grab the most iconic image of Osama Bin Laden, slap his face on the picture and say it's the real deal and suckers fall for it because the ease at which they can proliferate the "meme" is greater than the minor inconvenience they would need to take in order to find out it's complete bullshit. It's so bad, in fact, that they don't even process the image critically. They see a meme, laugh, press like and share, and off it goes to another user whose soul and personality has been completely drained from their Internet life.</div>
		<br><br>
		Memes that are meant to be funny are the most unoriginal, braindead form of humor to ever exist. But there are good things about memes, for instance, they are the most unoriginal, braindead form of humor to ever exist. Let me explain myself: all humor is unoriginal and braindead because that's what's funny to us. Things that make you think deeply aren't funny because they make you think deeply!  Hey, uh, can I get a... uh... BONELESS PIZZA! <i>wheezes</i> L0L.
		<br><br>
		Of course there are major differences between witty humor and regurgitated memes. But there's no point in criticizing what people find funny because it misses the point, which is to laugh at stupid shit. The problem with memes comes from people mixing laughing at stupid shit with things that have actual value and weight like politics, which require accuracy and quality. If we just leave memes in the realm of dumb things to laugh at the quality of the Internet will improve substantially and people might be assed to focus on things that matter.
