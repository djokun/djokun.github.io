There is a tendancy for people to try to make sense of the world. That's essentially what philosophy is, just us trying our best to make sense of a very very weird universe. As such there will probably never be consensus on the true nature of reality, for the nature of reality is precisely such that there are simply truths which we will never know. As most of the universe will forever be invisible to us, most of what we think we know will always be wrong. That truth stems from two causes: the first is that we are limited in our capacity to know things and the second is that there is a limit to what we can know.
<br><br>
Scientifically, our capacity for knowledge is greatly limited to only that which we can empirically observe. It makes sense, after all, how can something unobservable (or something which has an unobservable effect), be confirmed as the truth? Prior to Newton, the prevailing theory to explain motion was that things could only stay moving if there was something to keep them moving. That theory makes total sense, and without a way to vigorously test it, it was accepted as the truth for a long time. But Newton showed mathematically that that was not the case, and that it in fact makes more sense that things keep moving due to the <i>opposite</i> reason: that without a force to counteract motion something will keep moving forever. This realization is taken for granted now, but at the heart it is totally uninuitive. Truly, it is lack of intuition that limits our capacity for knowledge. For it is intuition that guides our research. Intuition is what shows us the path to follow to discovery.
<br><br>
There is also a limit to what we are capable of knowing.
