		Software, etc., I Use

		<h2>Operating System</h2>
	<p>
		I use GNU/Linux for my personal computing.
		Right now I am using Solus Linux.
		In the past I have used:
		<ul>
			<li>Ubuntu</li>
			<li>Debian</li>
			<li>Arch</li>
			<li>Manjaro</li>
			<li>Void</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the past I would have recommended Ubuntu to people who have never used GNU/Linux before, however in recent years Canonical (the company who maintains Ubuntu) have become increasingly shady.
		I also don't like snap packages and I prefer using a proper package manager&mdash;Canonical is gradually making snaps a requirement on desktop Ubuntu.
	</p>
	<p>
		To be honest, I still recommend Ubuntu for newbies to GNU/Linux simply because it is still the most ubiquitous GNU/Linux distribution out there.
		A lot of software will work on Ubuntu and is easily available, whereas smaller projects like Solus do not have as many packages.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want something that Just Werks&trade;, any of the following will do:
		<ul>
			<li>Ubuntu</li>
			<li>Manjaro</li>
			<li>Mint</li>
			<li>Solus</li>
			<li>PopOS</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
		<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<p>
		My personal computer is a Dell Latitude e6440 that I rescued from my university (read: I asked if I could have it because the power port was banjaxed).
		I've never purchased a personal computer in my entire life&mdash; an accomplishment I'm quite proud of.
		Nevertheless people often find themselves in need of a personal computer, whether because their current one broke or they feel they need to upgrade.
	</p>
	<p>
		I highly recommend, if you must purchase a personal computer, to buy one used or refurbished.
		Not only is it better for the environment, it is just plain savvy.
		Why waste a ton of money on a brand new computer when computers up to 10 years old work just fine?<a href=#f1>[1]</a>

	<p id=f1 class=footnote>[1] Computers "slow down" as they age because Windows is shit software. If we're talking online it's because most websites are also shit software (Javascript-ridden messes of spaghetti code to load hundreds of megabytes of ads). Install an ad blocker and use something that isn't Windows.</p>
	<p>
		Thinkpads used to be the pinnacle of laptops, but Lenovo is turning them into trash Mac clones like everyone else tries (and fails) to do.
		Not only that, but thinkpads have turned into hipster accessories.
		People want thinkpads because it makes them look cool, rather than for the functionality and dependability.
		Therefore, I recommend getting a Dell or HP equivalent (Dell Latitude series or HP Pavilion series).
		Apple computers are good but they're definitely overpriced.
		Not a problem if you buy used or refurbished, most of the time.
		If you're not into fixing your own computer an Apple will work really well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recently there have been a lot of startups focusing on making personal computers that are more customizeable and user-serviceable.
		I haven't had the good fortune to try any of them out!
