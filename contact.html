    By the way, attempting to obfuscate your email (by using [at] instead of @, for example) is utterly pointless.
    The bots that might scrape your email on your no-name website can easily substitute those obfuscations anyway.
    Preventing scraping requires measures other than simple find-and-replace on your contact information.

    Also, just in case, I want to make it clear that I am not looking for any web development services, lmao.

	<h2>Twitter</h2>
	<p>
    I used to have Twitter because it was better than Facebook (mainly the fact that the timeline wasn't arbitrarily shuffled and filtered), but I stopped using it because while Facebook is a growing malilgnant tumor, Twitter is a festering, infected wound of a platform.
    Everything on Twitter is absolute insanity and it only gets worse as time goes on.
    I see Twitter as a lost cause because the company encourages that environment.
