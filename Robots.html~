			<br>
			I think Robots are currently one of the largest threats to humanity. And I believe that there has been a sort of cult forming around science and technology. I would have liked to call it the Cult of Technology, but it already has a name: Transhumanism.
			<br><br>
			Now we should probably be clear on what transhumanism is. It is basically a philosophy whose goal is for humans to transcend themselves, i.e., to become "more than human". Of course it isn't actually specific about using technology to meet that end, but that is one of the most popular conclusions to reach--that we human beings use technology to overcome our limitations and become more than human. One subject of transhumanism is the singularity, which is the point at which technology becomes so advanced that all of our problems are solved. Of course that singularity is always only a mere 20 years away.
			<br><br>
			So what's the problem? Shouldn't we strive to be better than we were yesterday? Shouldn't we always seek to improve, to adapt, to overcome? I would join most people in saying yes. But there is an important caveat, and that is that there is a very big difference between improving yourself and trying to become something else. So now I'll say what most people think of when transhumanism is brought up: we're going to end up merging with robots and becoming superhuman cyborgs. I hope that fantasy never comes true.
			<br><br>
			For most people cybernetic implants will stop at RFID and GPS tracking chips implanted in their arm. Some people will have cybernetic prosthetics. And fewer will reach that point of godhood that transhumanists have wet dreams about. <i>Only the elite would become transcended</i>. Technology is not an equalizer. People don't magically get better once technology improves. Only when technology has propagated does it equalize, and technology never propagates evenly. If it did we'd have Great Power nations in Africa. There are numerous reasons why, but I would say the number one reason is because it isn't free. Free as in freedom, not as in no cost.
			<br><br>
			Most technology is proprietary, that is to say, it is tightly controlled by those who made it or posess it because they own the patent for it. But what need is there for patents? And let's be clear: patents are entirely useless for the vast majority of people because a patent alone <i>protects nothing</i>! You have to be able to defend a patent in court for it to be effective, and the patent office granting a patent does not guarantee that you can defend it. Thus, large companies with lots of money and legal resources benefit the most from patents, not the eccentric inventor. So why does the patent system exist? It was supposedly designed to protect the "intellectual property" of inventors. But the true reason is to stifle competition. After all, why else would it function to limit what other people can do with new technology?
			<br><br>
			Now if technology were Free (libre) then it would be able to propagate more evenly. That is to say, if technology were accessible to anybody in the way that <a href="http://fsf.org" target="_blank">Free Software</a> is accessible to anyone, then it is logical to conclude that more people would be able to use it! Only in that regard would human robotics ever become justifiable.
			<br><br>
			However even assuming that robotics technology becomes Free, I believe it is still a gigantic misstep to "augment" human beings. The first reason is because even with Free technology, augmentation would create a huge class division. There would be people who either choose not to "transcend", or simply do not have the means to afford or implement it. With free choice, when it comes to life-changing phenomena, it is better not to offer the choice to begin with. The alternatives are some people choosing yes and some choosing no, or  forcing everyone to choose yes. Eventually one of two things would occur: cybernetics would become outlawed in some countries, or NOT being a cyborg would be outlawed in others! It would become a means of identification--and governments would be more than willing to impose a universal standard in cybernetic identification.
			<br><br>
			The second reason is because transcending humanity is extremely arrogant. Why should people become more than human? Are we not satisfied with what we are? Are we not content with being the most dangerous and intelligent creature on our planet? And what of all the people who will inevitably be left behind? In the name of progress we will ironically forget to be compassionate. It happens time and again. These people in the Cult of Technology believe that all of our problems could be solved if only we had better tech! What they fail to understand is that every groundbreaking technological advancement introduces as many (often more) problems as it solves. The Internet, as an example, connected us to each other in ways that were never before possible, but at the same time, it also isolated us by putting the entire world at our disposal. For instance, there will soon be no reason to go shopping at a real store when all of it can be done online. It also introduced new ways to commit crime. But the creators of the Internet didn't think about these things because they only could think of the wonderous possibilities of unlimited information. We have to consider the good with the bad and make well thought out decisions. But with the Cult of Technology that is impossible.
			<br><br>
			We should be focusing on solving tangible problems instead of constantly introducing new ones. The folly in believing that new technology will solve everything is tantamount to destroying one disease with another equally malignant and persistent one. And I haven't even begun to touch upon the ramifications of AI. In short, I think we should be very careful when dealing with robotics and other emerging tech. However, I know that people won't be careful, which means that extreme measures may have to be taken in the future, and I hope it doesn't come to that.
