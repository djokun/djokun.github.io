<div><br><u><b>JavaScript Revisited</b></u></div>
<p>
<br><br>
I wrote an <a href="JavaScript.html" target="_self" style="color: yellow;">article</a> in the fall of 2017 highlighting my grievances with JavaScript, but my approach wasn't accurate to my beliefs. The original article implied that JavaScript is the cause and not the effect. My opinion is not that JavaScript is bad on a technical level, or even that it is bad at all. My opinion is that the use of scripting as a default feature of web browsers is an ethical violation that also happens to pave the way for malicious entities to take advantage of users. JavaScript just happens to be the prevailing tool for providing dynamic interfaces on the World Wide Web.
<br><br>
Computer programs are often compared to cooking recipes, but there is a fundamental distinction between web browser scripts and a cooking recipe. If we consider the web page to be like the final product of a chef (the food), then we're making a mistake in comparing the source code to the chef's recipe. That is because unlike the food, the web page script is run automatically without the option to reconsider (by default). In contrast, a person is able to examine food to determine if there might be poison in it, and they may also ask for the recipe <i>before</i> touching the dish. Assuming the chef is honest and provides the actual recipe, one could then easily determine if the contents are poisonous. On the web, though, once the web page is visited it is already too late, the script has been executed and any malicious content with it. Of course, the scripts will only run for as long as the web browser is open. But if they are running silently how would one know that they are in danger?
<br><br>
Security is somewhat of a flimsy argument because all security measures can be circumvented. Any lock can be broken into, any wall can be broken down, and any computer can be hacked. But malicious behavior isn't relegated to hackers. The very sites we trust such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google use JavaScript to collect data about their users and sell that information. And because it is so prolific, any sites that use their JavaScript (e.g., Facebook's like button) also collect that data even if the victim is not a user of their services. Security is just a small facet of the issue here. The real issue is poor ethics and evil behavior.
