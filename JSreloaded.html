		<div><br><u><b>JavaScript Revisited</b></u></div>
			<p>
			<br><br>
			I wrote an <a href="JavaScript.html" target="_self" style="color: yellow;">article</a> in the fall of 2017 highlighting my grievances with JavaScript, but my approach wasn't accurate to my beliefs. The original article implied that JavaScript is the cause and not the effect. My opinion is not that JavaScript is bad on a technical level, or even that it is bad at all. My opinion is that the use of scripting as a default feature of web browsers is an ethical violation that also happens to pave the way for malicious entities to take advantage of users. JavaScript just happens to be the prevailing tool for providing dynamic interfaces on the World Wide Web.
