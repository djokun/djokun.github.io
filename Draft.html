			<br><br>
			<p>
			Most things in our lives are out of our control. And when I say most I really mean almost everything. So it puzzles me when people push the idea that hard work, intelligence, creativity, and other Middle-American traits are the keys to success and happiness. While it's true that these things are important qualities and skills for a person to have, at the same time they are paradoxically nearly meaningless because the key events in our lives happen by chance: where and when we are born, what school we go to, who we meet and become friends with, relationships we form. Although such things appear to occur due to our decisions, there is also a duality existing with what is essentially a roll of the dice.
			<br><br>
			Does that mean nothing we do matters? No, not really. The hardest thing to understand is that while our entire lives are determined by external forces, our own actions and decisions still influence the outcome. That is what is meant by the saying "hard work brings good luck", though that is putting things too simply in my opinion. It is true that we work hard in order to create success and happiness, but it is also true that for most people, no matter how hard they work, they will never escape their miserable situation. Hard work only brings good luck to those who are already lucky. That doesn't make hard work worthless; after all, it doesn't matter how lucky someone is if they never roll the dice.
