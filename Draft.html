			Most things in our lives are out of our control. And when I say most I really mean almost everything. So it puzzles me when people push the idea that hard work, intelligence, creativity, and other Middle-American traits are the keys to success and happiness. While it's true that these things are important qualities and skills for a person to have, at the same time they are paradoxically nearly meaningless because the key events in our lives happen by chance: where and when we are born, what school we go to, who we meet and become friends with, relationships we form. Although such things appear to occur due to our decisions, there is also a duality existing with what is essentially a roll of the dice.
			<br><br>
			Does that mean nothing we do matters? No, not really. The hardest thing to understand is that while our entire lives are determined by external forces, our own actions and decisions still influence the outcome. That is what is meant by the saying "hard work brings good luck", though that is putting things too simply in my opinion. It is true that we work hard in order to create success and happiness, but it is also true that for most people, no matter how hard they work, they will never escape their miserable situation. Hard work only brings good luck to those who are already lucky. That doesn't make hard work worthless; after all, it doesn't matter how lucky someone is if they never attempt to utilize it. Therefore I would classify luck as the force which determines three things: the groundwork on which a person's life is based, the efficiency of a person's labor (in terms of how much or how little it takes to move up in the world), and a person's fortune--the random events we have no control over which improves a person's life or makes it worse.
			<br><br>
			Some questions are raised, though. For instance, what can explain how a person's luck can change, such as a homeless person winning the lottery, or, in the opposite situation, a person losing everything? I would make the argument that their luck hasn't actually changed at all. In order for their luck to have changed we would need to treat each instance of a person's life as an independant event--the case in a dice roll or coin toss--but in actuality events in our lives are interconnected not only with each other but also with those of other people. Thus, between every person in the world, there is a sort of network of luck that influences events and outcomes. It isn't the person's luck that changes, but how their life responds to their luck. I will illustrate with this example: if someone is homeless and wins the lottery it isn't because their luck changed, and the reason is because it was their homelessness that prompted them to make the attempt to win at that point in time. Remember that events in life are not independant like dice rolls, each thing that happens has a cascading effect. Things happen because other things also happened.
			<br><br>
			What determines someone's luck, and how can we know how lucky we are? Unfortunately I think those things are impossible to know. Some people believe that astrological signs and events are the causes. I think it's a futile attempt to try to "read" someone's luck. Although someone may appear to be unlucky, for all we know, the unfortunate events that they must endure could be the very things which enables their good luck to make itself known. It's only at the end of life that we can really know how lucky or unlucky a person was.
			<br><br>
			I must clarify at this point that there are two kinds of luck. One form of luck is attributed to events--for example, nearly missing a deer while driving could be considered lucky<sup>1</sup>. The other form of luck, which is my main focus here, is an attribute of people. Lucky people can still experience unlucky events, it's just that all events in their life, whether they are lucky or unlucky, lead them to good fortune.
			<br><br>
			The title of this article is "Luck is the Most Important Skill", but so far I have only touched on luck as a trait or attribute. So how can luck be a skill? The skill of luck is how well a person makes use of their luck. Since luck is useless without work, but not determined by work, the luckiest people in the world can still be very lazy and get nowhere in life<sup>2</sup>. At the same time work is also useless without luck. Thus, the combination of luck and work is the skill of luck. Without that skill it is impossible to succeed and, more importantly, impossible to be happy.

		1. It's hard to classify events as lucky or unlucky. Is nearly missing a deer any more lucky than never seeing the deer to begin with?
		<br>
		2. I will not attempt to define what constitutes success in this article.
