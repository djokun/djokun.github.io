    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I started this website as an outlet to express myself in c. 2017.
      Back then it was under the domain djokun.org.
      I had always wanted to have my own website, and it served as a place where I could write about this and that.
      I was in my early 20s back then, so you can imagine the kind of things I wrote about, heh.<a href=#f1>[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p id=f1 class=footnote>[1] I was the "20-something philosopher type" if you couldn't tell...</p>
    <p>
      I dropped out of university in 2015, originally studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
      Things like that can look and feel like giving up, but choosing not to do something is a choice we have to make sometimes.
      I had a lot of very high hopes and dreams that seemed to crash down on me all at once.
      I don't think everyone should do this by any means, but I do think many people could benefit from waiting before going to university.
      I did go back in 2019 to finish a Bachelor of Science (I changed to Environmental Science).
      That felt like a bigger risk than dropping out, but thanks to my girlfriend (now fianc&eacute;) also deciding to go for a Master's Degree at the same time I was able to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In studying Environmental Science I was exposed to what is now my career: Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
      Sometimes you don't know what your career will be.
      Actually, I don't think most people end up where they think they will!
      The lesson for me was not to get stuck in a box, no matter what that box looks like.
      There are always options available.

      Anyway, you can check out my <a href=posts.html>posts</a> if you want to read my stuff.
