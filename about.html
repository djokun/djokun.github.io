<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>My name is Daniel Okuniewicz Jr. and this is my personal web page. I usually post my writings on here, but I may also post video and audio files in the future. It is basically a creative outlet for me to share whatever I want.</p>
<p>In the future I may make more use of this page for other reasons, personal or professional. I’ve thought about uploading my CV here but at this point in my life I don’t think that’ll do anything.</p>
I encourage everyone to read my writing and <a href="contact.html"><strong>Contact</strong></a> me to talk about just about anything. <br> <a href="index.html"><strong>Home</strong></a><br><br><br>
